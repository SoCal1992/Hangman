After the game starts, you will be presented with the beginning hangman image, along with the amount of syllables of the word, and the amount of guesses you have left. You are only allotted 6 guesses.
The game allows you to guess the whole word or letter. 

If you want to guess the word, type the whole word and press enter. If it is correct, a congratulations message will appear and you won the game. If it is not correct, part of the hangman will be drawn, the amount of guesses counter will subtract by 1. 

If you want to guess the letter, type the letter and press enter. If it is correct, it will be filled into it's correct spot of blanks within the word. If it is not correct, part of the hangman will be drawn and the amount of guesses will subtract by 1.

If you've used all of your allotted guesses, a "You lose" message will appear, followed by the correct word to guess.
